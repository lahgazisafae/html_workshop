### HTML
- HTML stands for hypertext markup language
- Difference between markup and programming language: you can't do computations with markup
- HTML consists of tags and attributes that make up elements

<h1> This is a header element</h1>
<img alt = "alternate to photo"/> 

- HTML is best learned by memorization and banging your head until something works 

- The basic body of an hmtl page: 
<html>
	<head>
	</head>

	<body>
	</body>
</html>


### CSS
- CSS adds styling to our page
- We are able to target specific parts of our HTML using selectors
